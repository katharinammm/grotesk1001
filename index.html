				<p>The Story</p>
			</div>

			<div class="description-text">
				<p>
				Grotesk 1001 (1001 as "Why designing a thousand and first Grotesk Font?" and "Thousand and One Night" magic) is a speculative experiment about emotions in type and the emerging technology Variable Fonts.
				<br><br>The starting point was the question whether the performativity of a text could be enhanced by adjusting the feeling of the font to the content of the text. Or would it rather disturb the readability?
				So I designed a relatively neutral Grotesk font, that was supposed to be adjustable to various emotions through the technology of Variabl Fonts.
				For that I followed the model of Universal Emotions. With this model, Paul Ekman assumed that the emotions anger, surprise, disgust, enjoyment, fear, and sadness are universal across all cultures. Another question arised: Can they be converted into universally-read font faces?
				<br><br>Designers usually choose a font to communicate a certain emotion. But what happens if one Variable Font contains various emotions? Can it still be considered as one font family?

					So, dear type-designers all over the world, I need your help!
					<br><br>I'm curious how a Grotesk-1001-emotion-style would look for you. You can download the OFT and TTF data in the <a href="https://github.com/katharinammm/grotesk1001">repository</a> and design your emotional variations! Grotesk 1001 is licensed as a Creative Commons, which  means you can use and modify it as long as it stays a Creative Commons and is not used for commercial use.
					<br><br>What would a sad Grotesk 1001 look like? Or a hangry one? I'm curious about your ideas and designs! Let's create together the emotionally most variable font so far!
